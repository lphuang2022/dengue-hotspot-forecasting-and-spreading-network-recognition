# dengue-hotspot-forecasting-and-spreading-network-recognition

This is the matlab code for dengue hotspot forecasting and spatial spreading network recognition.

Background: dengue transmission within short distance (generally one two severl hundred meters) is due to mosquitoes fly. While, the long distance transmission is due to human mobility.

The loss function is formulated as the residual between the estimation and the ground truth with both L1 and L2 as regularization. The estimation part incorporates the spreading network as an unknown and un-observed matrix, which is initalized randomly and learned by the gradient descent method. 

The model is evaluated on the recent seven years of dengue data of Singapore, and the learned spatial spreading network is compared with the community network, where the community network is generated by 2 million mobile phone users. Similarities between two kinds of networks help certify the relative effectiveness of the learned spreading network. 

The dataset for the recent dengue outbreak year 2020 is provided in the csv file.
